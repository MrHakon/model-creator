# model-creator
Small program that can be used to create a semantic model 

Planned updates:
  - Make the user input more streamlined: either write a whole triple in one sentence, or store a resource in memory until all properties are completed. 
  - Find a way to work with the vocabularies that are implemented in Jena
  - Add proper support for prefixes
